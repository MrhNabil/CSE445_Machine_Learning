CSE445: Machine Learning Course Projects
Welcome to the repository for CSE445: Machine Learning! This repository houses all the assignments and projects completed as part of the course, providing practical implementations of key machine learning concepts.

Project Overview
This repository features a collection of machine learning assignments, primarily implemented in Python using Jupyter notebooks. The projects cover a wide array of core ML topics, including:

Supervised Learning: Deep dives into both classification and regression problems.

Unsupervised Learning: Explorations into clustering techniques.

Data Preprocessing & Visualization: Essential steps for preparing and understanding datasets.

Algorithm Implementation: Both from-scratch implementations to build foundational understanding and utilization of popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized for easy navigation:

Installation
To get these notebooks up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/MrhNabil/CSE445_Machine_Learning.git
cd CSE445_Machine_Learning
(Optional) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

Bash

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Required Packages:
All necessary Python libraries are listed in requirements.txt.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter:
Once everything is installed, you can open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

Bash

jupyter notebook
This command will open a new tab in your web browser, displaying the Jupyter interface.

Usage
Open any assignment notebook (e.g., Assignment_1.ipynb) within the Jupyter interface.

Run the cells sequentially to execute the code and see the results.

Each notebook contains instructions and comments to guide you through the specific tasks and concepts being explored.

Requirements
To ensure compatibility and smooth execution, you'll need:

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook (or Jupyter Lab)

The Python libraries listed in requirements.txt, including numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
